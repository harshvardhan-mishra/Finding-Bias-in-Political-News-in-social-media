# Finding-Bias-in-Political-News-in-social-media
This project attempts to empower readers to better reflect on the content provided by their digital news outlets of choice.
There is a growing body of evidence of bias in the media caused by 
underlying political and socio-economic viewpoints. Previous studies have 
tried to classify the partiality of the media, but there is little work on 
quantifying it, and less still on the nature of this partiality. The vast amount 
of content published in social media enables us to quantify the inclination 
of the press to pre-defined sides of the socio-political spectrum. To 
describe such tendencies, we use tweets to automatically compute a news 
outletâ€™s political and socio-economic orientation. To show that the media 
have a measurable bias, and illustrate this by showing the favouritism of 
Chilean media for the ruling political parties in the country. This 
favouritism becomes clearer as we empirically observe a shift in the 
position of the mass media when there is a change in government.
